        <h2>Jabir is credited with the introduction of experimental methodology into alchemy 
          and the invention of several chemical processes used in modern chemistry. These include 
          crystallization, calcinations, sublimation and evaporation, the synthesis of acids 
          (hydrochloric, nitric citric, acetic and tartaric acids), and distillation using his greatest 
          invention, the alembic (Anbaiq).</h2>

          The bottom sits over a heat source and contains the substance to be distilled, and at the 
          top is a bulb with a tube sloping down and out (often these two are joined and are called a 
          retort, but if they are separate pieces they are referred to as the cucurbit and the alembic,
